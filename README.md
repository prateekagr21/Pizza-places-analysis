## Price Analysis and Prediction of Pizza using Machine Learning Algorithms !

### _`To quote from the show 'THE OFFICE' - "Whats' better?, a medium amount of good pizza or all you can eat pretty good pizza?"`_

_There’s a reason why pizza is so popular. Humans are drawn to foods that are fatty and sweet and rich and complex.
Pizza has all of these components. Cheese is fatty, meat toppings tend to be rich, and the sauce is sweet._

_Pizza toppings are also packed with a compound called glutamate, which can be found in the tomatoes, cheese, pepperoni and sausage.
When glutamate hits our tongues, it tells our brains to get excited – and to crave more of it.
This compound actually causes our mouths to water in anticipation of the next bite._

_Then there are the combinations of ingredients. Cheese and tomato sauce are like a perfect marriage. On their own, they taste pretty good.
But according to culinary scientists, they contain flavor compounds that taste even better when eaten together.
With bread, cheese and tomato sauce as its base, pizza might seem like a simple food._

## For Solving this Usecase, What I have done is :
- Collected the data and organized it to form a meaningful dataset.
- Checked for null values and took care of it.
- Observed the data to form meaningful insights!
<br><br>
- Did Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
- Used correlations to form a heatmap.
- Visualizations were made by using Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries..!!


## Did Data Pre-Processing :
- Made Binary Classifications Using Label Encoder
- and Standard Scaler 
<br> To fit and transform Numerical and Categorical Column values.


## And then I made my model for the Prediction :
- Independent and Dependent Features.
- Did Train-Test split



## Trained my Model using :

## _Linear Regressor_
- Fitted the model.
- predicted the test scores and checked the same.
- Plotted the prediction.
- `Prediction plot gave a Normal Distribution curve.`
- Plotted the Best fit line for the model.
- Calculated Mean Absolute error and Root Mean Squared Error!


## _XGBoost Regressor_
- Fitted the model.
- predicted the test scores.
- Plotted the prediction.
- `Prediction plot gave a Normal Distribution curve.`
- Plotted the Important features which gave the prediction for the model..
- Plotted the Best fit line for the model...
- Calculated Mean Absolute error and Root Mean Squared Error!


## _Random Forest Regressor_
- Fitted the model.!!!!
- predicted the test scores.
- Plotted the prediction.
- `Prediction plot gave a Normal Distribution curve.`
- Plotted the Important features which gave the prediction for the model..
- Plotted the Best fit line for the model...
- Calculated Mean Absolute error and Root Mean Squared Error!

## _And for the conclusion -_
#### _From the above three trained Models, It can be seen that the Random Forest Regressor model performed better than xgboost and the Linear Regressor Model._
